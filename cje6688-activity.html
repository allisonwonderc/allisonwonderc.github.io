You enter the building and a security guard stops you.</p><blockquote>&quotSir, where do you think you're going?&quot</blockquote><blockquote>&quotI'm here to investigate a crime scene.&quot</blockquote><blockquote>&quotCrime scene!&quot the security guard exclaims. &quotThere's no crime scene here.&quot</blockquote>"+ "<button onclick=returnCheckpoint()>&quotAren't you a little young to be a security guard?&quot</button>"+"<button onclick=moveStory()>&quotI'm sorry for the misunderstanding.

Still, you're gonna need these.</blockquote><p>Maxwell hands you a pair of gloves.</p>"+ "<button onclick=moveStory()>&quotAre these nitrile or latex?&quot</button>"+"<button onclick=moveStory()>&quotDo you ever fill these with helium to make balloons?&quot</button>";

The scene is cordoned off with bright yellow crime scene tape. Object, stain, and fiber locations are marked with numbered yellow tents.</p><p>You take Maxwell's lead and begin to write notes regarding the location of computer stations, wires, peripheral devices, the state of the room.</p><p>The office is well-kempt, despite the crowd of investigators gathered there.</p>"+"<button onclick=moveStory()>Continue</button>";
