c1 ="<blockquote><p>&quotI hope you have been well,&quot he said. &quotI need your help on a complex case. We'll be walking into a live response effort and I know you've wanted to see one for a while.</p><p>&quotI was recently asked to swing by the Ion-ivation building as a consultant. This is all very hush hush, but because you signed a non-disclosure agreement as my intern, I can fill you in on what's been going on. There was a massive data breach of PII. The CTO says that his team is estimating 160 million records were stolen, including opt-in HIPAA protected information. Ion-ivation was conducting experimental drug testing and apparently they were close to entering the market. Now, they aren't sure if that data has been sold to a competitor or used for credit card fraud.</p><p>&quotCare to tag along?&quot</p></blockquote>" + "<button onclick=returnCheckpoint()>Tell Maxwell you don't feel qualified for the job.</button>"+"<button onclick=moveStory()>Take the offer!</button>";
c2 = "<p>You meet up with Maxwell at the Ion-ivation Trade Building.</p><p>It's on the corner of 25th and Ada Ave. You don't know much about the company, but you think you've seen something on the news about how Ionivation's stock has been exponentially increasing in value over the last few months. Before hanging up, Maxwell mentioned that they caught a young data entry clerk attempting to empty out her office before her shift, apparently trying to shred the contents of her filing cabinet. She was arrested for trespassing and property damage from breaking a lock, and Ion-ivation asked law enforcement to assist in preserving the possible scene of the incident.</p><p>You enter the building and a security guard stops you.</p><blockquote>&quotSir, where do you think you're going?&quot</blockquote><blockquote>&quotI'm here to investigate a crime scene.&quot</blockquote><blockquote>&quotCrime scene!&quot the security guard exclaims. &quotThere's no crime scene here.&quot</blockquote>"+ "<button onclick=returnCheckpoint()>&quotAren't you a little young to be a security guard?&quot</button>"+"<button onclick=moveStory()>&quotI'm sorry for the misunderstanding. Let me see if my friend can clear this up.&quot</button>";
c3="<p>Maxwell notices that you did not follow him. He opens his wallet to flash an ID at the security guard. After I sign in with the building's visitor log, we head upstairs. In the elevator, Maxwell fills you in on the investigation so far.</p><blockquote>&quotWe've already secured the scene. The company was concerned about the possibility of a defamation suit. The initial evidence collection team arrived about an hour and a half ago, so they already took prints from the workstations. Still, you're gonna need these.</blockquote><p>Maxwell hands you a pair of gloves.</p>"+ "<button onclick=moveStory()>&quotAre these nitrile or latex?&quot</button>"+"<button onclick=moveStory()>&quotDo you ever fill these with helium to make balloons?&quot</button>";
c4="<p>Maxwell ignores your questions.</p><p>The elevator doors open. You walk down a carpeted hallway into an office and see the assembled response team.</p><p>You check in with the technician in charge of the log of those going in and out of the scene. Collection and analysis is already underway. The scene is cordoned off with bright yellow <i>Do Not Cross</i> tape.</p><p>You take Maxwell's lead and begin to write notes regarding the location of computer stations, wires, peripheral devices, the state of the room.</p><p>The office is well-kempt, despite the crowd of investigators gathered there.</p>"+"<button onclick=moveStory()>Continue</button>";
c5="<p>Maxwell gestures for you to walk with him to the east corner of the room. There is a computer workstation with a desk placard on it.<i>Judy Haus</i>, it reads.</p>"+"<button onclick=returnCheckpoint()>Take a picture of your shoes</button>"+"<button onclick=moveStory()>Take a picture of the desk.</button>";
c6="<p>On the desk, you notice a sticky note.</p>"+"<judypass></judypass>"+"<p>Evidence! This could come in handy.</p>"+"<button onclick=moveStory()>Continue</button>";
c7="<p>You look over Maxwell's shoulder. He is writing down the fact that the computer in question is a Lenovo Yoga attached to a Dell monitor by a USB to HDMI connection.</p><blockquote>&quotYou remembered your toolkit, right?&quot he asks you.</blockquote>"+"<button onclick=moveStory()>Of course.</button><button onclick=returnCheckpoint()>Nope, I can't believe I forgot it!</button>";
c8="<blockquote>&quotYou have everything? Great. Do me a favor and make an image of this computer's hard drive.&quot Max hands a piece of notepaper to you. &quotI already made an image of the drive, and this was the hash I received. Go ahead and do it yourself to make sure yours matches.&quot</blockquote><p>The hash value on the paper is c662b3869659e7eaac7ae623af9b20b0.</p><p>The Lenovo is powered on already and is displaying a screensaver.</p><button onclick=moveStory()>Follow procedure and jiggle the mouse</button>";
c9="<p>The desktop is locked, but you can still take a disk image. You use two flash drives and a USB splitter to attach a destination drive and your portable toolkit. In your toolkit USB, you have loaded FTK Imager Lite. You use this to make a bit by bit image of the target Lenovo computer.</p><p>When the image creation is finished, the program returns an MD5 hash value: c662b3869659e7eaac7ae623af9b20b0. This matches the one Maxwell gave you! The image is forensically sound.</p><p>Maxwell is already busy analyzing his image of the target disk. He has opened the full version of FTK and is conducting a string search for the terms <i>theft</i>, <i>steal</i>, and <i>hipaa</i></p><p>Because you have finished extracting an image of the disk, you set to work tagging the cables with colored stick-on tags to indicate their order and where they are attached. Recording this helps to verify that no storage devices are missed and that the workstation can be reassembled if needed.</p>"+"<button onclick=moveStory()>Finish packaging the laptop and peripherals</button>";
c10="<p>Maxwell looks concerned.</p><blockquote>&quotI found an Excel spreadsheet encrypted with TrueCrypt. I'm sure we can decrypt with enough time, but I think that this will help us catch the people behind this before they use the data they stole.&quot</blockquote><p>He must have missed the sticky note on the desk!</p><blockquote>&quotI think the password is right here. That's almost too easy.&quot</blockquote><p>He enters the credentials in the photo documentation you took of the evidence.</p><blockquote>&quotIt works. Looks like this spreadsheet is a file of contact information for all of Ion-ivation's competitors. We may luck out if none of them were interested in purchasing stolen data. <h2>&quotGreat work!&quot</h2></blockquote>";
