<h1>Capricorn and Libra Compatibility</h1>
<p>When Capricorns and Libras get together romantically, it's utter garbage. A real dumpster fire. Sure, they may THINK they're happy and their best selves when together, but that's largely due to the fact that Libras are ruled by the Earth ambassador of the cockroach while Capricorns find guidance from the oppossum. In short, they are both eating from the trash can - and the name of the trash can is ih-dee-ah-low-gee.</p>
